         <h1>About the Project</h1>
         <h7>Project ID: 9</h7>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <p>The project data set gives information about Disney movies from 1937 to 2017. It makes available comparisons between movie qualities like genre, rating, gross income, and date released. Using this data set, we produced visualizations that reveal information about Disney movies, such as the most popular movie season, the distribution of maturity ratings, the highest-grossing genres, etc. This information is useful because it can inform movie producers of the different aspects of high-producing movies and influence decision making about what types of movies to produce and when to release them. Through data analysis, we have been able to  identify trends and patterns in high-grossing movies.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <h1>Exploration Questions</h1>
         <p>Question 1: Do the maturity levels of films affect gross income?</p>
         <p>Question 2: What genres bring in the most gross income?</p>
         <p>Question 3: Is there a peak season to release a movie?</p>
         <p>Question 4: Is there a certain genre-rating combination that brings in a large amount of income?</p>

         <h1>Data Visualizations</h1>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Seasonal Data</h2>
         <h4>Number of Movies Released Per Season</h4>
         <p>The following visualization shows that Disney has realeased the most movies in the Fall.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <iframe src="https://kosborn5.github.io/Disney-Movie-Data-/data_viz_embed_pg.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>
         <p>Initially, we hypothesized that Disney would favor releasing movies during the summer and winter, assuming that the school break in summer and major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas in winter would drive popularity. However, contrary to this assumption, more movies were released in the fall and spring.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <h4>Infaltion Adjusted Gross Income Generated by During Different Seasons</h4>
         <p>The following visualization shows that Disney has earned the most on movies released during the Winter.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <iframe src="https://kosborn5.github.io/Disney-Movie-Data-/data_viz_embed_pg5.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>
         <p>Disney has generated more than $18 billion in revenue from films released during the winter season. Despite releasing the fewest number of movies during winter compared to other seasons, their holiday-themed films have proven to be major successes.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-5'></div>
         <h2>Genre Data</h2>
         <h4>Infaltion Adjusted Gross Income Generated by Various Genres</h4>
         <p>The following visualization compares the level of gross income generated by different genres of movies.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <iframe src="https://kosborn5.github.io/Disney-Movie-Data-/data_viz_embed_pg3.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>
         <p>Disney's Adventure film category has amassed a revenue exceeding $16 billion. The three highest-grossing movies within this genre are Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, Finding Dory, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-5'></div>
         <h2>MPAA Rating Data</h2>
         <h4>Number of Movies Released For Each MPAA Rating</h4>
         <p>The following visualization shows that most of the movies Disney has released are PG.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <iframe src="https://kosborn5.github.io/Disney-Movie-Data-/data_viz_embed_pg2.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>
         <p>The predominant rating for Disney's movies is PG, indicating that the primary demographic for their films consists of children under the age of </p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <h4>Infaltion Adjusted Gross Income Generated by Various Ratings</h4>
         <p>The following visualization compares the level of gross income generated by different ratings of movies. Disney's PG movies have brought in over $19 billion dollars.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <iframe src="https://kosborn5.github.io/Disney-Movie-Data-/data_viz_embed_pg4.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>
         <p>This data confirms what is commonly known about Disney—that it is a company for children and families. The movies that are rated G or PG do far better financially than their more mature films. Seeing the contrast between the $19 billion earnings of PG movies compared to $8 billion earnings of R movies is a clear demonstration of the audience and genres at which Disney thrives.</p>
        <div class='py-3 my-5'></div>
         <h2>Year Released Data</h2>
         <h4>Infaltion Adjusted Gross Income Generated Over the Years</h4>
         <p>The following visualization looks at how gross income has changed over the years.</p>
         <div class='py-3 my-4'></div>
         <iframe src="https://kosborn5.github.io/Disney-Movie-Data-/data_viz_embed_pg6.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>
         <iframe src="https://kosborn5.github.io/Disney-Movie-Data-/data_viz_embed_pg7.html" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>
         <p>Both of the visualizations above are representations of the same data. However, the bottom graph zeroes in on a smaller sample of the data because most movies in the data set are clustered from 1990 to 2017. Enlarging those dates makes it easier to see what the range in gross income is. You can see that there isn't a steady increase or decrease by the year; rather, movies had random fluctuations of success or failure. The bottom graphs also allow you to see the popularity of movies based on genre. The upper visualization is better suited for general data through a longer period of time. It shows the striking contrast between "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" compared to other high grossing movies that came later on—none of them coming close to grossing higher.</p>
